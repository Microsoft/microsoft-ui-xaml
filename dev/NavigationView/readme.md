# NavigationView Control

NavigationView is a powerful control that makes it easy to integrate a rich navigation experience into apps.
This document outlines overall structure and behaviors.
Information related to the NavigationViewItem, or the rendering of the control see the documents in the /NavigationView/docs folder.

## Architecture

NavigationView is a complex control, which has a lot of internal states to store.

Rendering of the menu items is being done through three ItemsRepeaters, one for the NavigationView in left mode, one for the NavigationView in top mode and one for the overflow menu.
For more on this, see [the rendering document](./docs/rendering.md).

The selection is being tracked through a SelectionModel, which uses IndexPath tracking for hierarchical NavigationViewItems.
Every NavigationViewItem can be selected by either setting the `IsSelected` property of a NavigationViewItem, or setting the selected item.
To allow this, every NavigationViewItem is aware of its parent NavigationView.

Keyboard navigation is done by the NavigationView, however handling of ItemInvokation is being handled by both the NavigationView and the NavigationViewItem.

## Flows

### NavigationViewItemInvoked Selection

1. NavigationViewItem gets invoked
2. NavigationView gets informed that an item was invoked
3. NavigationView raises ItemInvoked
3.5. NavigationViewChecks the Item's SelectOnInvoke property, if false we are done, if true:
4. NavigationView updates selection
5. NavigationView notifies the invoked NavigationViewItem about its new selection state
6. NavigationView raises SelectionChanged

### Selection update from API (SelectedItem property)

1. SelectedItem gets set
2. SelectionModel updates internal selection
3. Previously selected NavigationViewItem gets unselected
3. New selected NavigationViewItem gets selected
4. Update UI (SelectionIndicator, Flyouts)


### Compact pane length change
1. The NavigationView gets notified it compact pane length changes
2. Adjusts the pane length buttons widths
3. Tells all of the NavigationViewItems to adjust their icon column width


### Accessibility

To ensure accessibility, both the NavigationView, and the NavigationViewItem provide their own AutomationPeers and implement the needed pattern.

Keyboard accessible navigation is being handled by the NavigationView.
